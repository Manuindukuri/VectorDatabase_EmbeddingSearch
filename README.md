**Welcome to our custom built application to explore vector databses for efficient embedding search to generate prompt based on user specified content and questions in a large language model**

# OPEN AI CHATBOT

OPEN AI CHATBOT is a comprehensive project that combines two distinct pipelines for data acquisition and embedding generation using Apache Airflow and a client-facing application built with Streamlit and FastAPI. The project addresses a real-world scenario where we extract data and metadata from PDF files and store them in Pinecone, a vector database for efficient embedding search to prompt in large language model. The project answers to the question asked by the user using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

## Overview:

-**Pipeline 1:** Data Acquisition and Embedding Generation

Designed for data acquisition and embedding generation.
Parameters specified in YAML format include a list of PDF files for processing, chosen processing option (either "Nougat" or "PyPdf"), and credentials for processing.
Implements data validation checks to ensure accurate data parsing.
Generates embeddings and metadata for chunked texts.
Saves the extracted data in a CSV file into the S3 bucket for further use.

-**Pipeline 2:** Pinecone Database Integration

Parameterized source path of the CSV file from S3 bucket for loading into the Pinecone database.
Capable of creating, updating, and deleting the index as needed when data is refreshed.
This application is built using Streamlit and deployed on a Streamlit Cloud Platform. The project utilizes Amazon S3 for storage and Apache Airflow for managing the transcription workflow.

## Pages and features:

-**Login:** Users can login from this page. If the user is not registered, it will show invalid login details and the user will have to first register by accessing the register page.

-**Register:** Users can register on this page. Here we are implementing the user registration and login functionality with JWT authentication to secure API endpoints. After the registration is successrful, a confirmation email is sent to the email id which they entered while filling the details on the login page. After the registration is succesful, only then the user can see the view forms and ask me page.   

-**View Forms:** Users can select and view the SEC Government Forms available for display, then they can select the library from which they want to see the content. Depending upon which library i.e PYPDF or NOUGAT is chosen the user can view the extracted content of the form. 

-**Ask:** Allows users to input queries and utilizes Pinecone's Similarity search for information retrieval. It also supports 
filtering by form or querying across all items for comprehensive results. The model returns the answer to the query by using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model
